<h4>About Us</h4>
<p><b>The department of Civil Engineering is the largest and one of the earliest Engineering departments of NIT Srinagar established in the year 1960. It consists of a group of highly qualified and experienced faculty, supported by experienced technical staff and a good laboratory infrastructure. The department offers instructions at undergraduate level leading to4-year B.Tech degree in Civil Engineering and at the post graduate level leading to M.Tech degrees in Water Resources Engineering, Structural Engineering, 
Geotechnical Engineering and Transportation Engineering & Planning, and also Ph.D. degrees.</b></p>
<p><b>The instruction at the undergraduate level aims at providing the students a broad based education with emphasis on theory and
 practice of Civil Engineering, keeping in view the current and future requirements of the industry.</b></p>
 <p><b>At the post graduate level, students are trained to assume independent responsibilities 
 laying emphasis, again on country current and future requirements in the industry, organisations, 
 design firms and academic institutions. Field visits are arranged for students at all levels to acquaint them with practical knowledge in the various areas of Civil Engineering. The department is well equipped to carry out research leading to M.Tech and Ph.D. degrees. The department also takes Consultancy Assignments from industry in the areas of Geotechnical Engineering, 
 Transportation Engineering, Structural Engineering, Water Resources Engineering, Surveying etc</b></p>
