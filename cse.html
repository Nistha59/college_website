<h4>About Us</h4>
<p><b>The Department of Computer Science& Engineering was started in the year 2007, offering four year 
undergraduate courses, wherein undergraduate students are imparted knowledge in multitude of specialties, 
including: computer Architecture, Network, Operating System, Data Structure and Algorithm, Theory of Computation,
 Numerical analysis, Compiler design, Graphics, Artificial intelligence, Database Management System, Data mining,
 Software Engineering, Human computer interaction, etc. The Department of Computer Science and Engineering 
 embodies the Institute's tradition of excellence as a world-class leader in computer science and engineering 
 education and research. CSE is in a period of exciting growth and opportunity.<br><br> In the current ever evolving 
 industrial scenario contents delivered to the students are regularly updated by the faculty members who have 
 themselves been at the helm of path breaking research and innovations In addition to academic work, the CSE 
 department also has computer science research programmes (for a full listing of specialties visit Research Areas) 
supported through government and industry funding. Faculty research helps define and expand the current and 
future use of technology. Mission and Vision : At NIT Srinagar, we believe that their is no dearth of scope 
for bright and vibrant stars in the firmament.We therefore persistently strive to inculcate the requisite
